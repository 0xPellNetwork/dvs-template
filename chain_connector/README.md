# Directory Overview

This directory provides a gateway for interacting with blockchain operations, specifically designed to write DVS (Decentralized Verification System) results into smart contracts on the blockchain. We offer a complete example to demonstrate the integration process. **However, it is important to note that in actual DVS development, utilizing this connector service is not mandatory and depends on the specific business requirements of the DVS application.**

# Chain Connector

This section describes a simple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service that receives task results from DVS (Decentralized Verification System) nodes and writes them onto the blockchain. This service acts as a bridge between the DVS nodes and the blockchain, ensuring that task results are securely and efficiently recorded on-chain.
